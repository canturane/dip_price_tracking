# dip_price_tracking



This Python script monitors the price of a specific cryptocurrency from the "crypto.com" website. It periodically fetches the current price and compares it to previously recorded prices. If a price drop is detected (i.e., the current price is lower than all previously recorded prices), the script will print a notification indicating the drop. Otherwise, it will display the current price.
